            <p id="maincontent">Valorant is a free-to-play, team-based, first-person hero shooter developed and published by Riot Games. Players play in
                teams with each playing as an Agent of the Valorant Protocol. Agents (link here) have abilities, each requiring
                charges, as well as a unique ultimate ability that requires charging through kills, deaths, orbs, or objectives. Each 
                match of Valorant takes place on a Map (link here) which are important locations according to the lore of the Valorant 
                Universe.
            </p>
            <p>There are various game modes that can be played, with four main modes: Deathmatch, Spike Rush, Unrated, Competitive. 
                These modes can be accessed permanently with some more other modes that are available on a rotating basis.
            </p>

            <h3>
                Deathmatch
            </h3>

                <figcaption>Deathmatch Mode</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Deathmatch is a free shooting mode designed to let player hone their gunplay mechanics for actual gameplay in the rest of the modes.
                Abilities are disabled in this mode and the main focus is on shooting skills. First person to get 40 kills before the 9-minute timer
                is up, wins the round.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Unrated
            </h3>
            <figure>
                <img class="modes_img" src="images/Modes_Competitive.png" alt="Unmrate Mode"/>
                <figcaption>Unrated Mode</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Unrated is Valorant's standard mode. Players are divided into two teams where the Attacker team's objective is to plant and detonate 
                the bomb (called Spike) and the Defender team must prevent the Attackers from completing their mission with by defusing the Spike
                eliminating the Attackers completely. Both gunplay and unnique ability use are required in this mode. First team to 13 rounds win (Best of 25).
                Games in the Unrated mode last from 30-40 minutes.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Competitive
            </h3>
            <figure>
                <img class="modes_img" src="images/Modes_Competitive.png" alt="Competitive Mode"/>
                <figcaption>Competitive Mode</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Competitive is a higher stakes version of Unrated where players play competitively to earn and compete for a rank. Should a game reach
                a 12-12 scoreline, the games instead goes into Overtime where the first team to get a 2-round lead on their opponent wins the game. 
                Players can vote every two rounds on whether to continue Overtime, which can result in the game ending in a draw should enough players
                vote for this option. This mode lasts for 30-40 minutes.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Spike Rush
            </h3>
            <figure>
                <img class="modes_img" src="images/Modes_Spike_Rush.png" alt="Spike Mode"/>
                <figcaption>Spike Rush Mode</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Spike Rush is a shorter version of Unrated. Instead of buying their weapon of choice, players are provided a default gun for the round, which
                they must use unless an upgrade is possible. First team to 4 rounds wins (Best of 7). Spike Rush games last about 8-12 minutes.
