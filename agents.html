            >Agents are playable characters in the game, each from on a different culture or country of the world. Each agent has unique
                abilities. The type of ability an Agent has is decided by the class they belong to. There are four main classes or roles of Agents 
                in Valorant. The play style and ability of an Agent is decided by their class.
            </p>

                Agent Roles
            </h2>
            <h3>
                Controller
            </h3>
            <aside aria-label="Controller description">

                </figure>
            </aside>
            <p>Controllers specialize in "slicing up dangerous territory to set their team up for success."[25] They use their abilities to 
                create coverage or clear out areas of space with crowd control. To help their team enter into enemy territory, their abilities
                consist of some kind of smoke, as well as molotovs, stuns, or flashes. With their smokes, controllers can control sightlines
                on the map, making it safer to move through the map without getting seen.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Duelist
            </h3>

                </figure>
            </aside>
            <p>Duelists specialize in attacking and entering a bomb site for the team. Duelists mainly create space for their team while 
                entering onto a site, giving their teammates information, and making entering a site easier. Their abilities tend to consist of
                flashes which blind enemies, and movement-based abilities that allow for them to cover large distances faster than other agents.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Initiator

                </figure>
            </aside>
            <p>Initiators plan out the offensive pushes. Initiators specialize in breaking through defensive enemy positions. Initiators' 
                abilities can consist of flashes but also abilities that can reveal the location of enemies. This information allows for attackers
                to know where enemies are and make taking a site easier.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Sentinal

            </aside>
            <p>Sentinels are the defensive line, which specializes in locking down sites and protecting teammates from enemies. Their abilities
                mainly consist of static 'objects' that are obstacles to the enemies. These objects can give the team valuable information and/or
                deal damage. On attack, sentinels can use their abilities to cut off certain parts of the map or set up 'objects' that can ensure 
                the enemy cannot flank without being noticed.
