        <p>Matches in VALORANT take place on different maps. Maps are prime locations in the Valorant universe where Radianite is found.
            Each map contains two or three sites where the Spike can be planted and separate spawn areas for Attackers and Defenders.
            Every map has a unique feature that allows diversity in the gameplay to be maintained.
        </p>

        </figure>
      <p>Situated in Rabat, this sandy map consists of many corridors and narrow pathways, giving rise to close fights and surprise launches.
        The two planting sites can be accessed quickly during site rotations through teleportation portals, which are unique to the map.

       <p> Ascent is an aerial landscape situated in Italy. It has two planting sites (A and B) and a huge, open middle area. Ascent is a crowd-favorite pick.
        The unique features of this site are the mechanical doors present on both sites. The doors provide control to the team present on the site.

    </figure>
      <p>Haven is the only site in VALORANT with three planting sites (A, B, and C). It is located in Bhutan. Haven has a combination of both long range
        and short range areas in the map. It is a defender-friendly map.

        <figcaption>Split</figcaption>
    </figure>
      <p>Split is another crowd favorite map that allows for varied gameplay. Set in Tokyo, Split has a very lucrative mid area that attackers
        love to target. It has vertical ziplines on both sites as its unique feature. Players can rapidly elevate or lower themselves mid fight.

        <figcaption>Ice Box</figcaption>
    </figure>
      <p>Ice Box is the largest map of the rest of the maps yet, with huge open spaces for long range gun fights, excellent for sniping. Being the only 
        site with horizontal ziplines and elevated planting sites, ice box has a steep learning curve which resulted in many players detesting it initially, but 
        later warming up to it. Ice box is situated in Russia.
